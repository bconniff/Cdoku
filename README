CDOKU - C SUDOKU SOLVER

Cdoku is a program for solving Sudoku puzzles using Donald Knuth's Dancing
Links (DLX) implementation of Algorithm X. This version of the program is
written entirely in C, and licensed under the 3-clause BSD license. You can
find license details in the LICENSE file, located in the root directory of the
source distribution.

The program solves Sudoku grids by converting them into an instance of the
exact cover problem, solving the exact cover, and then converting the result
back into an instance of Sudoku.

The program will find a solution to a puzzle if at all possible, and will also
detect if a puzzle is unsolvable.

Cdoku is essentially a C port of a similar program I wrote called Jadoku,
written in Java. You can find Jadoku at:

USAGE

Using Cdoku is simple, invoke it like this:

   cdoku [file]...

This program take a list of files as arguments. Each file contains a list of
puzzles, one per line. Each puzzle is a string of 81 digits, representing the
cells on a Sudoku grid from top-left to bottom-right. Any non-numeric value is
considered an empty cell.

REQUIREMENTS

To build Cdoku, you'll need a C compiler and the make command. The program
is ANSI C, and should compile wherever you want.

COMPILATION

Cdoku comes with a basic Makefile for building the "cdoku" binary. Assuming
your compiler is GCC and you have "make" installed, from the root of the source
distribution, simply run the command:

   make

If you use a C compiler other than GCC, you can set the command for your
compiler by editing the "CC" variable in the Makefile. After running make, you
can find the program binary at:

   bin/cdoku

You can feel free to copy this file to any location within your path, or simply
run it from it's current location.

Building and running Cdoku has only been tested on Mac OS X, but I see no
reason it shouldn't work just as well on other UNIX systems or Linux. It
quite possibly works on Windows too.
